# React Portfolio Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the React Portfolio Challenge as part of the Bootcamp: UofW-VIRT-FSF-PT-05-2023-U-LOLC-MTTH course. In this challenge, I created a portfolio website using React to showcase my web development projects and skills. The goal was to deploy the application to Netlify and present it as a single-page application.

## What I Accomplished

- Built a single-page portfolio application using React.
- Created a Header component to display my name and navigation titles for different sections.
- Implemented navigation titles for "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume," with the active section highlighted.
- Designed individual sections for "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume" with relevant content.
- Developed a contact form in the "Contact" section with validation for required fields and email address format.
- Listed my web development projects in the "Portfolio" section with links to deployed applications and GitHub repositories.
- Added a link to download my resume and listed my technical proficiencies in the "Resume" section.
- Included a Footer component with links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform profile.
